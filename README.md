# AdoNet-MARS

<h4>MARS (Multiple Active Results Sets)<+h4>
<li>Structure that allows us to pull multiple recordsets into the application environment and access them over the same open connection
If MultipleActiveResultSets=true is not used in ConnectionString, MARS effect is not seen. By default, the value of the MultipleActiveResultSets property is false. The MARS technique works if the MultipleActiveResultSets value is explicitly set to true.</li><br>

<li>In this project, I showed the Insert operation and the final version of the table formed after this operation by using Connected/Disconnected architectures in the MARS structure.</li> <br>
